I believe the problem here is that _facebook.html.erb is loading the facebook div and JS file which are somehow destroyed and reloaded on each facebox (when clicking ""add account"") This seems to break several aspects of the Facebook JS SDK and callbacks or subscribed events no longer function and therefore the user cannot Logout through our app on any successive clicks to ""add account"" without a full page refresh.",-1
