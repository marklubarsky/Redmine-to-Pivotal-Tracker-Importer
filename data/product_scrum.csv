My project this year is political forecasting at the state level using Twitter.  For example, to predict the outcome of the Florida primaries, I need to have the data broken down to account for just a single state.  Being able to filter Twitter data down to the state level will be an invaluable research and marketing tool alike.""

I would mostly need something to search through LinkedIn  conversations, so Groups and forums (maybe LinkedIn questions too) for specific keywords, preferably even those in which I'm not a member yet. Also, I'd like to track and analyze my own groups' and company page's acitivity, e.g. a tool providing an industrial sorting of page visitors or group members would be very useful. And of course, the usual things like diagrams how the number of visitors has been changing, how many people have been directed to the webpage from LinkedIn sources, main influencers in given topic, etc.
