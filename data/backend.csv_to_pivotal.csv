- Get the XML from AG.

Detect ES Parse Errors,"redmine,redmineID-142,redmine-Development",bug,unscheduled,11/21/2011 11:24 am,,"If a malformed profile is passed to ES, ES pops an error saying the query is wrong. Detect this and automatically mark the query as bogus.",-1
Make sure Statistics does not compute bogus queries,"redmine,redmineID-141,redmine-Development",bug,unscheduled,11/21/2011 11:22 am,,"Staff might mark profiles that are malformed as bogus. This flag is located in the user's table for alerts. If the profile is bogus, do not compute statistics for this profile.",-1
Create new build system for all projects,"redmine,redmineID-140,redmine-Development",bug,unscheduled,11/21/2011 11:20 am,,"Right now Client, Server, and Statistics are using a makefile system that is auto generated by Eclipse. We need to create our own build system:

- Create new build system
- Create a machine that builds the code each night and stores it on a SAN.",-1
Add cache key collating for statistics,"redmine,redmineID-139,redmine-Development",bug,unscheduled,11/21/2011 11:18 am,,"Each day, the stats cluster creates a key for traffic and other metrics. Each key contains:

a) 1 day
b) 7 days
c) 30 days

In order to do that, status recomputes this data each day by doing a raw query on the data. In order to make this more efficient, we can simply do today's stat and then take keys from the past and add those up to compute 7 and 30 making it far more efficient then doing raw queries again.

Add compression for cache inserts,"redmine,redmineID-138,redmine-Development",bug,unscheduled,11/21/2011 11:15 am,,"All records that are inserted into Membase need to be compressed as well. The following needs to be updated:

- Update DB routines to account for compression during insert and gets.
- Update Frontend web to detect compression and try to uncompress it. If it is not compressed, it should return as normal.
