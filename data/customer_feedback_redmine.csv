- twitter: who's talking about my competitors, of these people who has the most influence (followers). that's it. How much are they tweeting
- Facebook: who's posting, liking, sharing etc. etc. of my competitors, what are the competitors doing themselves
- Same for bloggers (I use google alerts now).

For all of the above I would like to have as much data as possible (6months or more)

Personally I'm not so into algorithms, I want to see the raw data myself and then be able to 'peel the union' and when needed dive in deep, really understand it. 

Probably I need a simpler or easy to use tool. I also want to know exactly how the data is collected to make my own judgement (and I don't want to spend a lot of time on how to video's), the service must be very intuitive to use."

Your interface is lovely and easy to use, but I need a more robust social media monitoring tool.  I need a system that has archival data, rather than just data from the day I opened the service; I need a system that can mine my company's facebook page and parse out all posts and comments in an excel spreadsheet so I can do sentimetrics; I also need a system that is accurate; as I was pulling up Twitter data, I noticed that Viralheat was missing tweets that Radian6 picked up.  

Thank you.

After thinking a bit more about what Viral Heat could do for me and my clients and probably a lot of other people.    The three things that would constitute a great package:
 
1.  Find relevant content as you are doing but then do a great job of clustering it so I'm not tempted to wade into the raw mentions because I am confident that VH is presenting me with all the found ""topics"" (ranked by ""heat"").  I want to work at the topic level (not mentions), so ""topic"" needs to become an entity.  It feels like you are heading in this direction but it comes through as fuzzy in the UI.
 
2.  Let me tag topics for my own workflow purposes.  The tagged topics will become a primary to-do list for me.  Of course you could extend this with more workflow capability in future. 
 
3.  Keep up with your lead initiative.   For each lead stream I want to refine with an online ""more like this"" and ""less like that"" signals.  It sounds like you are heading in this direction.  And of course CRM integration is hot these days.
 
Any chance your roadmap might develop along these lines?

thx Vishal.  user is randykun and pw is viralheat.
 
Another question for you.   One feature that would be very nice is the ability to flag items.   Even a primitive color scheme and then I could set up basic workflows.  This would let me record what mentions I've dealt with, which ones are top priority and which ones I want to ignore for the moment.  That sort of thing.   Any possibility that might ever happen?   (Could the difference between having to consider a Radian6 etc.)
 
thx...Randy
