139,New,Development,Bug,Normal,Add cache key collating for statistics,Gautam Sampathkumar,"","",Raj Kadam,11/21/2011,"",0,"","",11/21/2011 11:18 am,11/21/2011 11:18 am,"Each day, the stats cluster creates a key for traffic and other metrics. Each key contains:

a) 1 day
b) 7 days
c) 30 days

In order to do that, status recomputes this data each day by doing a raw query on the data. In order to make this more efficient, we can simply do today's stat and then take keys from the past and add those up to compute 7 and 30 making it far more efficient then doing raw queries again.

- Update DB routines to account for compression during insert and gets.
- Update Frontend web to detect compression and try to uncompress it. If it is not compressed, it should return as normal.
